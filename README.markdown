## 特色<br>Features
### Less Missing Details
This series is made by an acquainted player of Undertale and is attempt to make sure that most necessary gaming details are recorded in this video

Of course some (small) details will be missed, this should be redone to be fixed in later releases of the video

###  Sane Decisions...BUT
This series is attempt to follow sane decisions as a player that is fully acquainted to the game's plot, intended design and implications

Be warn that some decisions used in the series may in pratice not sane due to player instinct and other reasons, which may not be covered in this series(For example according to the plot the character should do choice A, but due to players' instinct they may do choice B(but it doesn't make sense if you actually really consider, the plot)).  This is really a dilemma that can't be solve by just playing one decision route, and is planned to do the 'fully sane' version and record an alternative 'player instinct' version afterwards

However another beauty of this game is it allowes variances to player that doesn't do the same decisions, this series is considered to be "sane and NOT sane at the same time"
