# Movie Script and Decisions
This contains the script used in this series, with decisions and it's reasoning

## Important Note
* Don't skip conversation until you meet the skip conversation hint Froggit, or it'll disappear

## 1. Once Upon a Time 
Intro with no skipping, that's all

## 1. Name the Fallen Human 
### Name of "The Fallen Human"
* The "Fallen Human" should be named "PLAYER" because it is designed to decieve the player to use their identity as the assumed "controlling character"'s name, and give surprises and (probably)guity to them afterwards.
* "Chara" shouldn't be used as it is entirely not in the game except for the "TRUE NAME" prompt, it is designed for players to discover it afterwards.

## 1. Your Best Friend
### Range
* Flowey's battle
* Toriel's introduction(Not separateble because of the timing difficulty)
* 1st save point

### Strategy in Flowey's fight
DODGE.  It is expected that the player to see the game's trailer before playing the game, the player should already know that this game's fighting style is "bullet hell" and should dodge Flowey's "friendliness pellets"

## 1. The Ruins(part 1)
### 1.1. TuToriel
Follow Toriel's instruction, don't talk to her if the instruction is trivial

### 1.1. Not so much puzzle puzzle
Follow instructions without trying the apparently wrong one

### 1.1. Dummy fight
1. Check
1. Talk

### 1.1. Froggit fight
1. Check
	* Player should check monster in first/unique encounter

### 1.1. Blueprint puzzle
* Notice the hint(even though most players failed to)

### 1.1. Long road(Unnecessary Tension)
* Just follow
* Do check the suspicious pillar

### 1.1. Even longer wait
* Wait for Toriel even when most players failed to
	* Saying Hello to Toriel to pass time, but don't call her mom or flirt her you filthy player ;)
	* Wait for Dog event ends and 2 additional rounds to be sure so we can decide to finally leave the room

### 1.1. Froggit's mercy hint
* Player should learn mercy by now

### 1.1. Save
* We don't go to the monster candy room first because the save point is the most noticible target

### Errata
* (fixed)<del>Window lose focus for few times<del>
* (fixed)<del>Not immediatly get the calls</del>
* (fixed)<del>Accidentally skipped dialog of snoring dog, which shouldn't happen as we merely know how to skip conversation yet(apparently this leads to the missing skip dialog Froggit in F4 room causing a recast)</del>
* Some rare timing BGM pitched up(dunno why)

## 1.1. The Ruins(part 2)
### Range
1. monster candy room
1. "Home" save point

### 1.1. Monster Candy Room
* Only get one candy as instructed
* Check wall even if doesn't work

### 1.1. Whimsun Battles
* First CHECK & CONSOLE, then simply just spare them
	* It is assumed that the player knows about the function of "yellow names" for now

### 1.1. Froggit Battles
* COMPLIMENT then SPARE(we've CHECK'ed Froggit in previous battle)

### 1.1. Hole Puzzle
* left exit first(so player knows the logic), then right

### 1.1.1. Toriel's Preference Call - Cinnamon or Butterscotch?
* Both are OK, director's decision

### 1.1.1. The fourth rock
* Trigger additional dialogs by pushing them when rock has moved to the expected location
