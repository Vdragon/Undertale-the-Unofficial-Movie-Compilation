# Movie Script and Decisions
This contains the script used in this series, with decisions and it's reasoning

## 1. Once Upon a Time 
Intro with no skipping, that's all

## 1. Name the Fallen Human 
### Name of "The Fallen Human"
* The "Fallen Human" should be named "PLAYER" because it is designed to decieve the player to use their identity as the assumed "controlling character"'s name, and give surprises and (probably)guity to them afterwards.
* "Chara" shouldn't be used as it is entirely not in the game except for the "TRUE NAME" prompt, it is designed for players to discover it afterwards.

## 1. Your Best Friend
### Range
* Flowey's battle
* Toriel's introduction(Not separateble because of the timing difficulty)
* 1st save point

### Strategy in Flowey's fight
DODGE.  It is expected that the player to see the game's trailer before playing the game, the player should already know that this game's fighting style is "bullet hell" and should dodge Flowey's "friendliness pellets"

## 1. The Ruins(part 1)
### 1.1. TuToriel
Follow Toriel's instruction, don't talk to her if the instruction is trivial

### 1.1. Not so much puzzle puzzle
Follow instructions without trying the apparently wrong one

### 1.1. Dummy fight
1. Check
1. Talk

### 1.1. Froggit fight
1. Check
	* Player should check monster in first/unique encounter

### 1.1. Blueprint puzzle
* Notice the hint(even though most players failed to)

### 1.1. Long road(Unnecessary Tension)
* Just follow
* Do check the suspicious pillar

### 1.1. Even longer wait
* Wait for Toriel even when most players failed to
	* Saying Hello to Toriel to pass time, but don't call her mom or flirt her you filthy player ;)
	* Wait for Dog event ends and 2 additional rounds to be sure so we can decide to finally leave the room

### 1.1. Froggit's mercy hint
* Player should learn mercy by now

### 1.1. Save
* We don't go to the monster candy room first because the save point is the most noticible target

### Errata
* Window lose focus for short time
* Not immediatly get the calls
* Accidentally skipped dialog of snoring dog, which shouldn't happen as we merely know how to skip conversation yet
* Some rare timing BGM pitched up(dunno why)
