# Movie Script and Decisions
This contains the script used in this series, with decisions and it's reasoning

## 1. Once Upon a Time 
Intro with no skipping, that's all

## 1. Name the Fallen Human 
### Name of "The Fallen Human"
* The "Fallen Human" should be named "PLAYER" because it is designed to decieve the player to use their identity as the assumed "controlling character"'s name, and give surprises and (probably)guity to them afterwards.
* "Chara" shouldn't be used as it is entirely not in the game except for the "TRUE NAME" prompt, it is designed for players to discover it afterwards.

## 1. Your Best Friend
### Strategy in Flowey's fight
DODGE.  It is expected that the player to see the game's trailer before playing the game, the player should already know that this game's fighting style is "bullet hell" and should dodge Flowey's "friendliness pellets"
